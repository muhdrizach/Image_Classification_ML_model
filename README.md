# Image_Classification_ML_model

• The project is a Machine Learning model capable of categorizing images into two categories such as Aeroplane and Car. It
leverages image preprocessing, feature extraction, and SVM classification to achieve high accuracy.
• The project includes a user-friendly website created using Flask, where users can input image URLs for real-time
classification.
• The image is fetched from the URL, resized, and normalized for feature extraction. The trained SVM model predicts the
category (Aeroplane or Car).
